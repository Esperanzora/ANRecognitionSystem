###accepted criteria
  - single digit:			90%                    
  - single alphabet:  75%

###current progress
  - single digit:			96%                    
  - single alphabet:  92%

####notes:
  1. currently the test (along with results) are performed in the main function under Reader.scala
  2. sequence recognition needs additional work
  3. overall performance can be further enhanced ("var" problems specificly)
  4. will be transforming the whole project into sbt
